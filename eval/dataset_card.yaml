description: |-
  A dataset for evaluating automation generation. The homes for this dataset were
  synthetically generated using gpt-3.5. This dataset is in development and contains
  just a few initial examples. Each benchmark creates a synthetic home fixture
  and configures the entities with a particular state, then asks for an automation
  for a specific set of devices.

  The benchmark loads a synthetic home and runs pytest with Home Assistant to
  run through scenarios that should trigger actions by the integration including
  automations.
